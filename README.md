#Movie Smash - Django web application

##What I used
* Web scraping for images
* Apache on linux to host the server so it could be accessed over the internet
* Mathematical algorithm for the elo ranking system
* Database to store the movie information
* CSV to parse the data from a csv file into the SQLite3 database
* HTML and JS to present the website
* AJAX on the index.html page to return the users results to the edit_rankings view
##What I have learned
* Use small data sets while in development of a project
* There is often a library for what you are trying to do (save yourself time if possible) give django example where order_by would have saved me 3+ hours talk about datatables
* I need to make my commits more isolated and follow a set format
* Update readme more frequently
#Things i could have done better
* Reading the AJAX post in the edit_rankings view was very clunky but It took me awhile to get working so i settled for the current method.
